# Four Wins (Connect Four) â€“ FOPBot

A lightweight **Connect Four** implementation in **Java** using the **FOPBot** simulation framework.
Players drop colored tokens into a grid; the first to align **four** tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
The board is rendered as a FOPBot world; tokens are represented by robots colored with `RobotFamily.SQUARE_BLUE` and `RobotFamily.SQUARE_RED`.
